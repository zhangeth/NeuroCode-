# NeuroCode-
The goal of this program is to simulate the resulting angles, velocities, accelerations, and torques of a one dimensional motor movement after a "brain" command is inputted. The arguments inputted include angle, velocity, acceleration, and  tau (time). Min_jerk_step(x,xd,xdd,goal,tau, dt) computes the update of x,xd,xdd for the next time step dt given that the point is currently at x,xd,xdd, and that we have tau until we want to reach the goal. A minimum time step is given into time loop as dt to generate the appropriate data sets. The data sets are then integrated to get the real angle, velocity, and acceleration data. The initial data of angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque calculated using min_jerk_step are then plotted against the integrated real data, and these should be very similar, with only differences in initial dependent variable values.
